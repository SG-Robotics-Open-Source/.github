# Welcome to SG-Robotics-Open-Source!

This is the central hub for open-source robotics projects at Saintgits College of Engineering.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to create a curated digital library of high-quality, working robotics projects developed by senior students. We do this to provide a strong foundation for juniors, saving them from reinventing the wheel and allowing them to focus on building new and innovative applications.

## How It Works

1.  **Browse Projects:** Explore our repositories to find a base robot or project that fits your needs.
2.  **Fork and Use:** Fork the project to your own GitHub account. This creates your own copy to work with.
3.  **Build Your Application:** Use the forked project as a launchpad for your coursework, personal projects, or competitions. You are free to modify it in any way you like.

You are not required to contribute your changes back, but we would love to see what you build!

## For Seniors

Have a well-documented project you'd like to contribute to our library? We'd love to feature it! Please get in touch with the organization admins to discuss adding your repository.
