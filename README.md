# Welcome to SG-Robotics-Open-Source!

This is the central hub for open-source robotics projects at Saintgits College of Engineering.

## Our Mission

Our goal is to create a curated digital library of high-quality, working robotics projects developed by senior students. We do this to provide a strong foundation for juniors, saving them from reinventing the wheel and allowing them to focus on building new and innovative applications.

## How It Works

1.  **Browse Projects:** Explore our repositories to find a base robot or project that fits your needs.
2.  **Fork and Use:** Fork the project to your own GitHub account. This creates your own copy to work with.
3.  **Build Your Application:** Use the forked project as a launchpad for your coursework, personal projects, or competitions. You are free to modify it in any way you like.

## Our Projects

### 1. [ros2_tutorial_ws](https://github.com/SG-Robotics-Open-Source/ros2_tutorial_ws)
**‚ñ∂Ô∏è START HERE!** This is a simple, fun project designed to teach you the basic workflow of cloning, building, and running a ROS 2 project.

### 2. [ros2_orion_ws](https://github.com/SG-Robotics-Open-Source/ros2_orion_ws)
**ü§ñ ADVANCED SIMULATION.** A complete software stack for an autonomous Mecanum-wheel robot. Use this as a foundation for advanced navigation, mapping, and sensor integration projects.
